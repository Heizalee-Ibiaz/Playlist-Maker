# Playlist-Maker
This Playlist Maker is a Java-based desktop application that demonstrates the use of a Doubly Linked List data structure. 
It includes features such as adding at the beginning, adding at a specific position, and adding at the end.
With this application, you can create a single playlist and arrange songs accordingly.
It does not use a database, as it is solely focused on showcasing the functionality of a Doubly Linked List.

The code can be modified to suit your preferences, including which artists you'd like to display.
If you choose to use it, please consider giving credit. Thank you!
